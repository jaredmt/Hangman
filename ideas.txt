hangman art ideas:
-simple stickman (easy to make)
-teddy bear (from the movie Ted?)
-disney
-mr. bill
-kenny from southpark

could either modify the image or just overlay a rope image (with transparency around the rope) over it


title should have a good font and maybe even an animation to it like this:
https://codepen.io/cguillou/pen/ubvFn

the letters that you guess will each be within a block. that block will have a border on the bottom and a small left-right margin
you can switch between 2 options: click each letter individually or switch to typing to a "console"
-use flex box to display each letter to pick

other features to add:

-hangman display
-icon (title)
-during current session: don't reuse the same names. keep popping names out of the list until it is empty
-rewrite code to be more readable
--use consistent variable names. ending in EL for all elements
--use id instead of class in appropriate places
-above letters: add a down arrow. this will toggle to a console (instead of clicking letters)
--the letters box will collapse and console will open
