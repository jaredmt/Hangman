hangman art ideas:
-simple stickman (easy to make)
-teddy bear (from the movie Ted?)
-disney
-mr. bill
-kenny from southpark

could either modify the image or just overlay a rope image (with transparency around the rope) over it


title should have a good font and maybe even an animation to it like this:
https://codepen.io/cguillou/pen/ubvFn

the letters that you guess will each be within a block. that block will have a border on the bottom and a small left-right margin
you can switch between 2 options: click each letter individually or switch to typing to a "console"
-use flex box to display each letter to pick

other features to add:
-new game button
-category selection box
-difficulty bar setting
--mostly difficulty will permet lesser known sentences
--the super easy will only be top 100 and 7 tries
-hangman display
-icon (title)
