#Hangman
This game was made using pure HTML/CSS/Javascript. It is just a fun and simple game of hangman with different categories to choose from.

##data sets
The data used in this game was extracted using puppeteer via nodeJS. All data was saved as a .json file so I could keep this project in the front-end and could easily be copied for anyone interested.
